Next Word Generator Using Transformer and LSTM
This project demonstrates how to generate the next word in a sequence of text using deep learning models, specifically Transformer and LSTM architectures. The model is trained on a large text corpus to learn language patterns and predict the most likely next word based on the input sequence.

Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a next-word prediction model using two different architectures: Transformer and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). These models are commonly used in natural language processing tasks due to their ability to capture complex relationships in text data.

Transformer model: Utilizes attention mechanisms to process input sequences in parallel, making it highly efficient for sequential data processing.
LSTM model: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) designed to model long-term dependencies in sequences.
Features
Text input: The model generates the next word given a sequence of input text.
Transformer and LSTM architectures: Both models are implemented to compare their performance on word prediction tasks.
Text corpus: The model is trained on a dataset of large text corpora, which could be books, articles, or other documents.
Preprocessing: Tokenization and padding are applied to prepare text data for training.
Algorithms Used
Transformer Architecture
The Transformer architecture is built around the self-attention mechanism, allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence at different levels of abstraction. It has proven to be highly effective in tasks like language modeling, text generation, and machine translation.

Key components:

Self-Attention Layers: Calculate the attention weights between tokens in the input sequence.
Positional Encoding: Adds information about the relative position of tokens in the sequence.
Feed-Forward Networks: Process the output of the attention layers.
LSTM Architecture
LSTM is an extension of traditional RNNs that addresses the vanishing gradient problem, enabling the model to capture long-range dependencies in sequential data.

Key components:

Cell State: The memory of the network, which can be updated and carried across timesteps.
Gates (Input, Forget, Output): Control how information flows through the network and influences future predictions.
Libraries Used
TensorFlow: Used to implement both the Transformer and LSTM models, as well as for training the neural network.
Keras: High-level API for building and training deep learning models.
NumPy and Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how both Transformer and LSTM models can be used for next-word prediction in text sequences. While Transformer-based models excel in capturing long-range dependencies with parallel processing, LSTM models are better suited for sequential data with memory cells that can retain information over time.

Future Work
Fine-tuning: Fine-tune the models with more data or specific domains to improve prediction accuracy.
Text Generation: Extend the project to generate longer text sequences, such as entire paragraphs or articles.
Model Optimization: Use pre-trained models such as GPT or BERT for better performance in text generation.
